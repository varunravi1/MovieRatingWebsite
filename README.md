Movie Rating Website Project Description
I developed a comprehensive movie rating website that allows users to create lists, rate movies, and view Rotten Tomatoes scores through a web scraper. The website is built using a full-stack approach with MongoDB, React, Node.js, Express, and Redis.

Key Features:
User Authentication:

Utilizes JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication, ensuring that user data and sessions are protected.
Movie Rating and Lists:

Users can create personalized movie lists, rate their favorite movies, and share their opinions with the community.
Rotten Tomatoes Integration:

Implemented a web scraper to fetch and display Rotten Tomatoes scores, providing users with additional insights into movie ratings.
Data Caching:

Leveraged Redis to cache recent data, significantly improving the website’s performance and reducing load times by minimizing repeated requests to the database.
Backend and Frontend Integration:

The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, handling API requests, data processing, and server-side logic.
The frontend is built with React, offering a responsive and dynamic user interface that enhances user experience.
Challenges and Solutions:
Data Scraping and Integration:
Implemented efficient scraping techniques to ensure accurate and up-to-date Rotten Tomatoes scores, handling any changes in the website’s structure dynamically.
Performance Optimization:
Used Redis for caching to enhance performance, ensuring quick access to frequently requested data and reducing server load.


Current Enhancements:
I am currently working on leveraging the Google Maps API to show nearby cinemas, allowing users to rate cinemas on various categories like seating, food, sound quality, and more. This information will be displayed next to each movie along with details about the streaming services where the movie is available. This enhancement aims to provide a holistic view of the movie-watching experience, combining both cinema ratings and streaming availability for user convenience.

Outcome:
The project successfully delivered a feature-rich, user-friendly movie rating platform that integrates multiple technologies to provide a seamless and engaging user experience. This project not only showcased my ability to work with a diverse tech stack but also demonstrated my skills in solving complex problems, optimizing performance, and implementing secure authentication methods.
