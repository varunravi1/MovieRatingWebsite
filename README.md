# Movie Rating Website

I developed a comprehensive movie rating website that allows users to create lists, rate movies, view Rotten Tomatoes scores through a web scraper, play a custom Moviedle game, and receive personalized movie recommendations. The website is built using a full-stack approach with MongoDB, React, Node.js, Express, and Redis.

## Key Features

### User Authentication
- Utilizes JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication
- Ensures user data and sessions are protected

### Movie Rating and Lists
- Users can create personalized movie lists
- Rate their favorite movies and share opinions with the community

### Rotten Tomatoes Integration
- Implemented a web scraper to fetch and display Rotten Tomatoes scores
- Provides users with additional insights into movie ratings

### Data Caching
- Leveraged Redis to cache recent data
- Significantly improves website performance and reduces load times by minimizing repeated requests to the database

### Backend and Frontend Integration
- Backend powered by Node.js and Express, handling API requests, data processing, and server-side logic
- Frontend built with React, offering a responsive and dynamic user interface that enhances user experience

### Moviedle Game
- Developed a custom Moviedle game inspired by Wordle
- Users can select between 3 time periods for a varied gaming experience
- Enhances user engagement and provides a fun, interactive element to the website

### Personalized Movie Recommender System
- Trained and implemented a custom recommender system
- Provides users with personalized movie suggestions based on their preferences and ratings
- Enhances user experience by helping them discover new movies tailored to their tastes

## Challenges and Solutions

### Data Scraping and Integration
- Implemented efficient scraping techniques to ensure accurate and up-to-date Rotten Tomatoes scores
- Handled changes in the website's structure dynamically

### Performance Optimization
- Used Redis for caching to enhance performance
- Ensured quick access to frequently requested data and reduced server load

### Recommender System Implementation
- Developed and trained a robust recommender system using machine learning techniques
- Integrated the recommender system seamlessly into the website's frontend and backend

## Current Enhancements

I am currently working on leveraging the Google Maps API to:
- Show nearby cinemas
- Allow users to rate cinemas on various categories like seating, food, sound quality, and more
- Display information about the streaming services where the movie is available
- Provide a holistic view of the movie-watching experience, combining both cinema ratings and streaming availability for user convenience

## Outcome

The project successfully delivered a feature-rich, user-friendly movie rating platform that integrates multiple technologies to provide a seamless and engaging user experience. This project not only showcased my ability to work with a diverse tech stack but also demonstrated my skills in solving complex problems, optimizing performance, implementing secure authentication methods, and developing custom features like the Moviedle game and personalized recommender system.

The addition of the Moviedle game and the custom recommender system, as demonstrated in the sample video, further highlights the project's innovative approach to user engagement and personalization in the realm of movie enthusiasts.
