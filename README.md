# Movie Rating Website

I developed a comprehensive movie rating website that allows users to create lists, rate movies, and view Rotten Tomatoes scores through a web scraper. The website is built using a full-stack approach with MongoDB, React, Node.js, Express, and Redis.

## Key Features

### User Authentication
- Utilizes JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication
- Ensures user data and sessions are protected

### Movie Rating and Lists
- Users can create personalized movie lists
- Rate their favorite movies and share opinions with the community

### Rotten Tomatoes Integration
- Implemented a web scraper to fetch and display Rotten Tomatoes scores
- Provides users with additional insights into movie ratings

### Data Caching
- Leveraged Redis to cache recent data
- Significantly improves website performance and reduces load times by minimizing repeated requests to the database

### Backend and Frontend Integration
- Backend powered by Node.js and Express, handling API requests, data processing, and server-side logic
- Frontend built with React, offering a responsive and dynamic user interface that enhances user experience

## Challenges and Solutions

### Data Scraping and Integration
- Implemented efficient scraping techniques to ensure accurate and up-to-date Rotten Tomatoes scores
- Handled changes in the websiteâ€™s structure dynamically

### Performance Optimization
- Used Redis for caching to enhance performance
- Ensured quick access to frequently requested data and reduced server load

## Current Enhancements
I am currently working on leveraging the Google Maps API to:
- Show nearby cinemas
- Allow users to rate cinemas on various categories like seating, food, sound quality, and more
- Display information about the streaming services where the movie is available
- Provide a holistic view of the movie-watching experience, combining both cinema ratings and streaming availability for user convenience

## Outcome
The project successfully delivered a feature-rich, user-friendly movie rating platform that integrates multiple technologies to provide a seamless and engaging user experience. This project not only showcased my ability to work with a diverse tech stack but also demonstrated my skills in solving complex problems, optimizing performance, and implementing secure authentication methods.
